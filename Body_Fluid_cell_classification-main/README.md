# Body_Fluid_cell_classification
This project explores the classification of body fluid cells using deep learning models on a 
large, annotated dataset. The dataset contains 12,966 cell images categorized into 14 unique 
cell types. The objective is to train a model capable of accurately identifying and classifying 
these cell types by leveraging image preprocessing, augmentation, and machine learning 
techniques.  
 
Data augmentation is particularly emphasized to address the imbalance in rare classes. The 
final model aims to achieve a robust performance with generalized prediction capabilities for 
unseen samples.
